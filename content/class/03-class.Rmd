# Class activity: Indigenous autonomy


Skim this article by [Foreign Policy](/files/right-to-kill.pdf) on the Kamayura in Brazil. In groups of 3-4, discuss the following: 

1. Should the Brazilian government intervene in any way with the Kamayura's practices? If so, how? Justify your answers. 

1a. If you think no, are there scenarios or things you believe a group *should not be* allowed to do its members?  What are those scenarios, and why?

1b. If you think yes, are there scenarios or things you believe a group *should be* allowed to do its members that would contradict national law? What are those scenarios, and why?
