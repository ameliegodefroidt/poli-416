## Class activity: Rebel propaganda


Let's look at these two communique's from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the Zapatistas from Chiapas, Mexico. 


- [Document #20: “Press Release from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,” Secretariat of the Central General Command of the FARC-EP (2002)](https://library.brown.edu/create/modernlatinamerica/chapters/chapter-7-colombia/primary-documents-with-accompanying-discussion-questions/press-release-from-the-revolutionary-armed-forces-of-colombia-secretariat-of-the-central-general-command-of-the-farc-ep-mountains-of-colombia-2002/)

- [EZLN Declaration of War (1993)](http://archive.oah.org/special-issues/mexico/zapmanifest.html)


Questions for discussion:

1. How do these two groups discuss their motivations for taking up armed struggle? What are their grievances? Who are the culprits?

2. How do these two groups differ in who they claim to represent? Who do they claim to be fighting for?
