<h2>Class activity: Informal work and social insurance</h2>
<p>In groups of 3-4, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributory programs are tied to taxes (good), but leave out huge and often poorer informal sector (bad)</li>
<li>Noncontributory programs alleviate poverty but also increase informality</li>
<li>Informality reduces access to public services, cuts down on revenue for the state, and might contribute to poverty</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you were a policymaker, where would you put your emphasis, and why? How would you balance trying to alleviate poverty <em>and</em> reduce informality (or would you even do this)? How would you try to reduce informality?</p></li>
<li><p>The chicken or the egg question: is it informality thatâ€™s standing in the way of economic growth, or does economic growth largely drive decision between formal/informal?</p></li>
</ol>
