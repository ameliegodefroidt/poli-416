## Data


We're going to work with data from [@fearon:laitin:2003]. 

- Download this: <i class="fas fa-download"></i> [Fearon data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a4clodqxj4rqj2i/fearon.csv?dl=1)



## Questions


1. How mountainous is each region, on average? 


2. How many observations do we have for each region? 


3. What percent of countries are reliant on oil? What about just in the MENA? 


4. How much more or less likely are countries with oil to have civil war onset? 



## Variable dictionary
