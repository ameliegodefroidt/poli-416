<div id="preparation" class="section level2">
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You will get the most out of this class if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> with the readings.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-sets" class="section level2">
<h2>Problem sets</h2>
<p>To hone your data analysis and writing skills you will complete problem sets throughout the semester. Feel free to work together on the homeworks but <em>you must turn in your own answers.</em> You cannot work in groups of more than <strong>two</strong> people.</p>
<div id="extensions-on-problem-sets" class="section level3">
<h3>Extensions on problem sets</h3>
<p>You can turn in the problem set one day late, no questions asked, though you will lose a full letter-grade. Beyond that I will not accept late problem sets so don’t ask.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level2">
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>There will be a midterm and a final. The midterm will cover the first half of the course, the final will cover the second half. Format will be a combination of multiple choice and short response questions.</p>
<p>Exam questions are drawn from: 1) lectures, 2) readings, and 3) in-class activities. With (3), whatever I write on the board is fair game for exams. I will post study guides for each exams in the <a href="/reference/">reference</a> section of the website.</p>
<div id="make-up-exams" class="section level3">
<h3>Make-up exams</h3>
<p>Make-up exams will be given <em>only</em> to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me <strong>before</strong> the exam or you will receive zero credit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="grade-disputes" class="section level2">
<h2>Grade disputes</h2>
<p>If you believe that you received the wrong grade on an assignment or exam:</p>
<ul>
<li>send an email specifying <strong>exactly</strong> which questions you believe were graded incorrectly, and provide <strong>specific</strong> justification for why your answer is the correct one. We will then regrade your entire assignment. Your grade may go up, down, or stay the same</li>
<li>please do not email to say you are generally unhappy with your grade, generally think it should be higher, or generally ask us to re-evaluate your grade</li>
</ul>
