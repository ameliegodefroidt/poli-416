<li>…how the new wave of Jihadi groups are similar and different to other armed actors</li>
<li>…the three different forms of warfare: conventional, SNC, irregular, and what each “looks” like</li>
<li>…how the rate of civil war <em>ocurrence</em> and <em>termination</em> has changed since the Cold War, and what explains these shifts</li>
<li>…what the “new” vs. “old” civil war debate was about, and whether this distinction really holds up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-causes-of-war">On causes of war</h3>
<h3 id="you-should-understand-1">You should understand…</h3>
<ul>
<li>…the bargaining model of war:
<ul>
<li>why war can be thought of as “bargaining failure”</li>
<li>what factors make bargains difficult to reach, specifically the factors that impact <em>civil wars</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>…the different <em>kinds</em> of grievances that sometimes motivate violence</li>
<li>…how <em>anomie</em> and changing demographics can contribute to violence</li>
<li>…why identity and ethnicity can become more or less salient in different contexts, and the implications salience has to violence</li>
<li>…what the <strong>security dilemma</strong> is and how it explains spirals of violence between groups</li>
<li>…how colonial rule can exacerbate ethnic tensions and produce conflict</li>
<li>…how Sunni and Shi’a relations were shaped by the US occupation (the Cockburn reading)</li>
<li>…how to situate the participation of wealthy slaveowners in the Confederacy in the “greed” vs. “grievance” debate</li>
<li>…how resource <em>lootability</em> and <em>commodity shocks</em> can makes conflict more or less likely, and how <em>opportunity costs</em> are part of the story</li>
<li>…why the kinds of resources groups have at <em>the start</em> of a conflict define how they behave <em>during</em> the conflict</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-wars-are-fought">How wars are fought</h3>
<h3 id="you-should-understand-2">You should understand…</h3>
<ul>
<li>…what irregular warfare looks like, what the identification problem is, and how this impacts relations between civilians and combatants (both state and rebel)</li>
<li>…the distinction Kalyvas draws between <em>selective</em> and <em>indiscriminate</em> violence, with examples of each</li>
<li>…why indiscriminate violence is thought to be very costly and counterproductive</li>
<li>…when we are likely to see <em>indiscriminate</em> vs. <em>selective</em> violence</li>
<li>…why civilians would choose to accurately <em>denounce</em> someone, falsely <em>denounce</em> someone, or keep quiet</li>
<li>…the relationship between territorial control, denouncement, and selective violence (basically that crazy graph)</li>
<li>…that COIN varies along a continuum, and be able to describe what that continuum is</li>
<li>…the challenges that counterinsurgents face, the different objectives they wish to accomplish and how these objectives are often in tension with one another</li>
<li>…how troop quality and ability to monitor troops impacts counterinsurgency success, and how states manage trade-offs between troop quality and troop supply</li>
<li>…the general logic of “hearts and minds” approaches to COIN, how states pursue this strategy, and its limitations</li>
</ul>
