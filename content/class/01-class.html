<p>We’re looking at this piece by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Carlin/publication/274969560_Natural_Disaster_and_Democratic_Legitimacy_The_Public_Opinion_Consequences_of_Chile%27s_2010_Earthquake_and_Tsunami/links/559d3d8308ae76bed0bb218b.pdf"><span class="citation">Ryan E. Carlin, Gregory J. Love, and Elizabeth J. Zechmeister, “Natural Disaster and Democratic Legitimacy: The Public Opinion Consequences of Chile’s 2010 Earthquake and Tsunami,” <em>Political Research Quarterly</em> 67, no. 1 (2014): 3–15.</span></a>.</p>
<!-- The claim they're wanting to test is whether Chile's devastating 2010 earthquake reduced citizens' trust in local government. To test this they use a survey fielded after the earthquake, where they assess whether *people who suffered damage from the earthquake (destruction of property, injury, etc.) exhibit lower trust in local government than people not hit by the earthquake*.  -->
<p>In groups, think about the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the <em>causal claim</em> the authors are trying to test?</li>
<li>What exactly is the argument as to why earthquakes decrease support for democracy?</li>
<li>Are all people in Chile equally likely to be affected by earthquake/Tsunami? Who is likely to be more/less affected?</li>
<li>What kinds of confounding variables<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> should we be worried about here?</li>
<li>Support for local government is measured on a 0 (no support) to 1 (full support) scale. How would you interpret the coefficient on page 10?</li>
</ol>
