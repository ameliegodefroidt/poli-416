# Things you should know for the Midterm



## Introduction to the course
## You should understand...


- ...how the new wave of Jihadi groups are similar and different to other armed actors
- ...the three different forms of warfare: conventional, SNC, irregular, and what each "looks" like
- ...how the rate of civil war *ocurrence* and *termination* has changed since the Cold War, and what explains these shifts
- ...what the "new" vs. "old" civil war debate was about, and whether this distinction really holds up

## On causes of war
## You should understand...

- ...the bargaining model of war:
    - why war can be thought of as "bargaining failure"
    - what factors make bargains difficult to reach, specifically the factors that impact *civil wars*
- ...the different *kinds* of grievances that sometimes motivate violence
- ...how *anomie* and changing demographics can contribute to violence
- ...why identity and ethnicity can become more or less salient in different contexts, and the implications salience has to violence
- ...what the **security dilemma** is and how it explains spirals of violence between groups
- ...how colonial rule can exacerbate ethnic tensions and produce conflict
- ...how Sunni and Shi'a relations were shaped by the US occupation (the Cockburn reading)
- ...how to situate the participation of wealthy slaveowners in the Confederacy in the "greed" vs. "grievance" debate
- ...how resource *lootability* and *commodity shocks* can makes conflict more or less likely, and how *opportunity costs* are part of the story
- ...why the kinds of resources groups have at *the start* of a conflict define how they behave *during* the conflict


## How wars are fought
## You should understand...


- ...what irregular warfare looks like, what the identification problem is, and how this impacts relations between civilians and combatants (both state and rebel)
- ...the distinction Kalyvas draws between *selective* and *indiscriminate* violence, with examples of each
- ...why indiscriminate violence is thought to be very costly and counterproductive
- ...when we are likely to see *indiscriminate* vs. *selective* violence
- ...why civilians would choose to accurately *denounce* someone, falsely *denounce* someone, or keep quiet
- ...the relationship between territorial control, denouncement, and selective violence (basically that crazy graph)
- ...that COIN varies along a continuum, and be able to describe what that continuum is
- ...the challenges that counterinsurgents face, the different objectives they wish to accomplish and how these objectives are often in tension with one another
- ...how troop quality and ability to monitor troops impacts counterinsurgency success, and how states manage trade-offs between troop quality and troop supply
- ...the general logic of "hearts and minds" approaches to COIN, how states pursue this strategy, and its limitations
