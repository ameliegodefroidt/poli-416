# Preparation

<span class="newthought">You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage^[Take detailed notes, do follow-up reading on things, people, places you don't know about.]  with the readings.^[Also ask for help from me or others in Slack!]


# Self-Assessment of Participation

At three points in the semester I will ask you to send me an email giving an **honest** and **realistic** assessment of your participation in class. 

Participation will cover (1) your attendance, (2) how much of the weekly readings you are completing, and (3) how much you are talking/answering/asking questions in class. You will give yourself a score from 0 to 10 and provide an explanation of why you deserve that score based on a rubric.^[Note that I reserve the right to reject your score!] 


# Pop Quizzes


I will hold somewhere between 6 and 20 pop quizzes (multiple choice, short-response) throughout the course of the semester. Pop quizzes will be administered at the start of class through Blackboard^[On paper for students without laptops]. 

Pop quizzes will cover **the reading that was due for that day**. Uncompleted pop quizzes = 0, and they can't be made up. You can drop the lowest 20% of your pop quiz grades at the end of the course (this includes 0's for absences). 


# In-class Simulation

One day in class we will simulate a key concept from the study of counterinsurgency. This simulation will involve the whole class and require active participation. You will get full credit for being present and involved on this day. If you are absent, you will have to write a 2-page paper on a theme related to the simulation. 


# Final Exam

A final exam will be held during exam week.  Make-up exams will be given only to students with medical or personal emergencies.  If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me **before** the exam or you will receive zero credit.

The final exam will cover all of the material from the course, including both readings and lectures. As the semester progresses, I will populate [the reference page](/reference/) with key concepts and ideas you will need for the final exam.
