<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">You will get the most out of this class</span> if you (1) attend class, (2) complete all the readings, and (3) engage<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Take detailed notes, do follow-up reading on things, people, places you don’t know about<br />
<br />
</span></span> with the readings.</p>
<h2 id="self-assessment-of-participation">Self-Assessment of Participation</h2>
<p>Rather than take attendance or grade participation, I will ask you to send me an email giving an <strong>honest</strong> and <strong>realistic</strong> assessment of your participation in class. There will be three of these at different points in the semester.</p>
<p>Participation will cover (1) your attendance, (2) how much of the weekly readings you are completing, and (3) how much you are talking/answering/asking questions in class. You will give yourself a score from 0 to 10 and provide an explanation of why you deserve that score based on a rubric that I will make available.<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Note that I reserve the right to reject your score if it’s outlandish.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<h2 id="pop-quizzes">Pop Quizzes</h2>
<p>I will hold somewhere between 6 and 20 pop quizzes (multiple choice, short-response) throughout the course of the semester. Pop quizzes will be administered at the start of class through Blackboard.</p>
<p>Note that (apart from book chapters) I am not making the readings available on Blackboard; this means you probably won’t have time to pull up unread PDFs mid-quiz.<span><label for="sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">If you go through the trouble of finding and downloading the readings but not actually reading the papers then my hats off to you. You’ve beat me.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>Pop quizzes will cover <strong>the reading that was due for that week</strong>. Uncompleted pop quizzes = 0, and they can’t be made up. You can drop the lowest 20% of your pop quiz grades at the end of the course (this includes 0’s for absences).</p>
<h2 id="midterm-exam">Midterm Exam</h2>
<p>The midterm exam will be take-home. Make-up exams will be given only to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me <strong>before</strong> the exam or you will receive zero credit.</p>
<p>The midterm exam will cover material for the course up to that point in the semester, including both readings and lectures. As the semester progresses, I will populate <a href="/reference/">the reference page</a> with key concepts and ideas you will need for the midterm exam.</p>
<h2 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h2>
<p>A final exam will be held during exam week. Make-up exams will be given only to students with medical or personal emergencies. If an emergency arises, you will need to contact me <strong>before</strong> the exam or you will receive zero credit.</p>
<p>The final exam will cover all of the material from the course, including both readings and lectures. As the semester progresses, I will populate <a href="/reference/">the reference page</a> with key concepts and ideas you will need for the final exam.</p>
