## Class activity


We're working with [this dataset](/files/balcells-kalyvas.csv) from [@kalyvas:balcells:2010]. 


The variables in the dataset:


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='asis', message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tribble(~Variable, ~Description, 
        "countryname", "Name of country",
        "year_start", "Year war began",
        "month_start", "Month war began",
        "year_end", "Year war ended",
        "month_end", "Month war ended",
        "conflict_name", "Name of conflict",
        "region", "Region",
        "gdp_capita", "GDP per capita (logged)",
        "rough_terrain", "Percent of country mountainous (logged)",
        "military_personnel_percapita", "military personnel per capita",
        "marxist", "Are rebels Marxist?",
        "technologyrebellion", "Technology of rebellion?",
        "ethnicwar", "Is this an ethnic war?") %>% 
  pander::pandoc.table(caption = "Variable dictionary", 
                              align = "ll", 
                       col.names = c("Variable", "Description"))
```



### Questions

1. How many conflicts began in 1992?
2. What was the **longest** war in years of fighting? The **shortest**?
    a. ðŸ”¥ Challenge ðŸ”¥: Can you incorporate the **month** variable? 
3. How many conflicts have there been in **each** region of the world?
    a. ðŸ”¥ Challenge ðŸ”¥: How many conflicts in each region **of each** warfare type?
4. Pick a conflict and look it up. Does the warfare type the authors assigned match well? If you can find a picture that is suggestive of the type, post it in the Discord.
