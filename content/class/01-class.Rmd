## Class activity


We're looking at this piece by [[@carlin:etal:2014]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryan_Carlin/publication/274969560_Natural_Disaster_and_Democratic_Legitimacy_The_Public_Opinion_Consequences_of_Chile%27s_2010_Earthquake_and_Tsunami/links/559d3d8308ae76bed0bb218b.pdf). 

<!-- The claim they're wanting to test is whether Chile's devastating 2010 earthquake reduced citizens' trust in local government. To test this they use a survey fielded after the earthquake, where they assess whether *people who suffered damage from the earthquake (destruction of property, injury, etc.) exhibit lower trust in local government than people not hit by the earthquake*.  -->


In groups, think about the following: 

1. What is the *causal claim* the authors are trying to test? 
2. What exactly is the argument as to why earthquakes decrease support for democracy?
3. Are all people in Chile equally likely to be affected by earthquake/Tsunami? Who is likely to be more/less affected? 
4. What kinds of confounding variables^[Remember a confounding variable is a variable that *causes* both our X and Y variable, like years married in the affairs example from class.] should we be worried about here?
5. Support for local government is measured on a 0 (no support) to 1 (full support) scale. How would you interpret the coefficient on page 10?
