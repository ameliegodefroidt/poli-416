</span></span> Persistent, low-level forms of violence affect even more countries, preventing people from living full and free lives.</p>
<p>In this class, you’ll learn about <em>why</em> violence plagues some places more than others, <em>how</em> strategy and local conditions shape the way armed actors wield violence, and <em>what</em> consequences violence has for civilians living in the cross-fire.</p>
<p>We will draw from political science, economics, history, journalism, ethnography, fiction, documentaries, and in-class simulations to develop an understanding of political violence as a theoretical concept, and how people around the world experience it. You should expect to do <strong>a lot</strong> of reading in this course.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the structural and historical sources of violence</li>
<li>Think about armed conflict as a strategic process involving states, civilians, and armed groups</li>
<li>Competently discuss three prominent cases of sustained violence in the contemporary era</li>
<li>Understand the challenges of policy aimed at building peace and order</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course materials</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">All of the readings in this class are free.</span></p>
<h3 id="articles-book-chapters-and-other-materials">Articles, book chapters, and other materials</h3>
<p>Most of our readings will come from journal articles, book chapters, and videos. For articles, you will have to look up and download the article on your own, either through <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/index.php">the library</a>. I’ll make book chapters available through this website or on the course Blackboard site.</p>
<h3 id="warning-on-violentdisturbing-content">Warning on Violent/Disturbing Content</h3>
<p>This course will require spending a significant amount of time covering violent and/or disturbing material, which can be difficult to read about or watch. I will do my best to flag especially graphic content but ask that you please consider this in deciding whether to take the course.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>You should listen to podcasts, although I won’t grade you on it. Here are some of my favorite podcasts that frequently discuss conflict and political violence:</p>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course policies</h2>
<h3 id="email-and-slack">Email and Slack</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Slack will be our main mode of communication.</span> We have a class Slack channel where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about the readings (e.g., “What does the author mean here…?”) or class logistics (e.g., “I can’t find the reading”) in the class Slack workspace.</p>
<p>I will monitor Slack regularly, and you should all do so as well. You’ll have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too. I will also post announcements and interesting/helpful content on Slack as the semester progresses.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak with me about something that only pertains to <em>you</em> (e.g., your grades, academic advice, reading suggestions), you can sign up for office hours on <a href="https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez">Calendly</a>. If there’s a time-sensitive emergency (e.g., car exploded) you can email me. Everything else goes in the Slack.</p>
<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Don’t cheat.</span> The Carolinian Creed is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously and urge all students to become familiar with its terms set out <a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/index.php">here</a>. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Creed’s application.</p>
<h3 id="cell-phones-and-laptops">Cell Phones and Laptops</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please turn off your phones or put them on silent before class.</li>
<li>Be respectful with your laptop use. You’re adults.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="counseling-psychiatry-services">Counseling &amp; Psychiatry Services</h3>
<p>Life at USC can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php">Counseling and Psychiatry Services</a> provides <em>confidential</em> support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges. Please do not hesitate to contact CAPS for assistance—getting help is a smart and good thing to do.</p>

<span class="newthought">If you think you received the wrong grade</span>, you will need to submit a memo (hard-copy, in-person) giving specific detail about why the grade should be changed. I will then <strong>re-grade the entire assignment</strong>.</p>
<p>Your grade might go up, go down, or stay the same, so try to be honest with yourself about whether a grade appeal is reasonable. Please note that I will <em>only accept grade appeals up to two weeks after the posting of a grade</em>.</p>
