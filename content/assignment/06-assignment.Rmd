## Instructions



Answer the questions (below), and keep track of your answers somewhere (a notepad?). You will input your answers into Canvas. **Figure out the answers *BEFORE* opening Canvas**, otherwise you'll run out of time. 




### Task 1: Elephant in the room


Look at the political cartoon below, from 1996, depicting Colombian presidential candidate Ernesto Samper. Do some digging around online, and in 3-5 sentences discuss the meaning and intention of each cartoon. Some guiding questions:

- What is each cartoon referencing? What point is the author trying to emphasize in each cartoon?
- Why an elephant? Why is it behind Samper? 
- What's the connection between the piggy bank and what Samper is saying in the second cartoon?

### Task 2: corruption and crime


Let's look at this survey data from Colombia, which captures responses from people living in very rural areas that have been affected by the conflict, and includes both people who were and weren't displaced during the war (variable dictionary below). Every row here is a person who completed the survey.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,results="asis"}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
tribble(~Variable, ~Description, 
        "sex", "Respondent sex",
        "hhsize", "Number of people in household",
        "age_num", "Respondent age",
        "displace", "Was respondent displaced?\n(1 = yes, 0 = no)",
        "yrs_dis", "Number of years that respondent has been displaced",
        "other_victim", "Was respondent victim of other violence beside displacement?\n(1 = yes, 0 = no)",
        "endorse_coca", "Should coca production be legalized?",
        "rest_yn", "Is respondent seeking restitution of property lost during diplacement\n(1 = yes, 0 = no)?",
        "dis_return", "Has respondent returned to community they were displaced from?\n(1 = yes, 0 = no)") %>% 
  pandoc.table()
```
