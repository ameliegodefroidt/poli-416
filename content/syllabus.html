</span></span> Persistent, low-level forms of violence is even more widespread, preventing people from living full and free lives.</p>
<p>In this class, you’ll learn about <em>why</em> violence plagues some places more than others, <em>how</em> strategic constraints shape the way armed actors wield violence, and <em>what</em> consequences violence has for people living in the cross-fire.</p>
<p>We will draw from political science, economics, history, journalism, ethnography, fiction, documentaries, and in-class simulations to develop an understanding of political violence as a theoretical concept, and how people around the world experience it.</p>
<p><strong>You should expect to do a lot of reading in this class.</strong></p>
<p><span class="newthought">By the end of this course,</span> you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify structural and historical drivers of violence</li>
<li>Conceptualize armed conflict as a strategic process involving states, civilians, and armed groups</li>
<li>Competently discuss three prominent cases of violence in the contemporary era</li>
<li>Understand the challenges of policy aimed at building peace and order</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="course-materials">Course materials</h2>
<p><span class="newthought">All of the readings in this class are free.</span></p>
<h3 id="articles-book-chapters-and-other-materials">Articles, book chapters, and other materials</h3>
<p>Most of our readings will come from journal articles, book chapters, and videos.</p>
<p>For articles, you will have to look up and download the article <em>on your own</em>, either through <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a> or <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/index.php">the library</a>. I’ll make book chapters available through this website or on the course Blackboard site.</p>
<h3 id="warning-on-violentdisturbing-content">Warning on Violent/Disturbing Content</h3>
<p>This course will require spending a significant amount of time covering violent and/or disturbing material, which can be difficult to read about or watch. I will do my best to flag especially graphic content but ask that you please consider this in deciding whether to take the course.</p>
<h3 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h3>
<p>You should listen to podcasts, although I won’t grade you on it. Here are some of my favorite podcasts that frequently discuss conflict and political violence:</p>

<h3 id="communicating-with-me">Communicating with me</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">You should come to office hours.</span> Confusion or questions about the reading are more easily cleared up in person than over email. If you have questions about your grades (see end of syllabus on grade appeals), or need to discuss absences, this should happen in person. You will get <em>better</em> help from me in person than over email. You can sign up for office hours <a href="https://calendly.com/juan-f-tellez">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also understand that some people may commute or have other difficulties coming to office hours. If you <strong>must</strong> email, please:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Be curteous (include subject line, “Dear Prof. Tellez,”) and to the point</li>
<li>I do not need to know you are missing a non-exam class</li>
<li>Do not email to ask what you missed during an absence (it’s on the syllabus!)</li>
<li>Do not ask for extensions on assignments. The answer is no</li>
<li>Do not ask for extra credit opportunities. There are none</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p><span class="newthought">Be nice. Don’t cheat.</span> The Carolinian Creed is in effect in this class and all others at the University. I will treat violations seriously and urge all students to become familiar with its terms set out <a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_integrity/index.php">here</a>. If you have doubts, it is your responsibility to ask about the Creed’s application.</p>
<h3 id="cell-phones-and-laptops">Cell Phones and Laptops</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please turn off your phones or put them on silent before class.</li>
<li>Be respectful with your laptop use. You’re adults.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="counseling-psychiatry-services">Counseling &amp; Psychiatry Services</h3>
<p>Life at USC can be complicated and challenging. You might feel overwhelmed, experience anxiety or depression, or struggle with relationships or family responsibilities. <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_health_services/medical-services/counseling-and-psychiatry/index.php">Counseling and Psychiatry Services</a> provides <em>confidential</em> support for students who are struggling with mental health and emotional challenges.

<p><span class="newthought">If you think you received the wrong grade</span>, you will need to submit a memo (hard-copy, in-person) giving specific detail about why the grade should be changed. I will then <strong>re-grade the entire assignment</strong>.</p>
<p>Your grade might go up, go down, or stay the same, so try to be honest with yourself about whether a grade appeal is reasonable. Please note that I will <em>only accept grade appeals up to two weeks after the posting of a grade</em>.</p>
